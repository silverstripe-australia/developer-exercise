This is a simple exercise for us to get an idea of your thought process when working on web based problems. While trivial in nature, we're looking for responses that indicate to us that your capabilities match those of the available position.

# The task...

Write an application that allows a user to create and update a series of content items in a web application.

A Page in the system should have

* A name field (text field)
* A content field (textarea)

All pages in the system should be displayed in a layout that has a list of all pages down the left side of the screen, and the page title and content on the right hand side.

Clicking on the linked page name on the left of screen should load its content on the right of the page. 

If the user is not logged in, they should be presented with a 'login' link - clicking that will replace the right content with a user/password entry field, and a login button. Clicking login will "login" the user (auth can simply be checking the username and password are the same). 

If the user is logged in, they should see an 'add page' button below the list, which will provide an interface for the user to add a new page with the indicated fields.


(Optional) 

When adding (or editing) a page, the page name should be unique within the system, so any attempt to save a page with the same name as an existing page should throw an error.

Users should not be able to submit the form with an empty page name field.


A bare minimum, possibly broken, implementation can be seen at https://symbiote.github.io/developer-exercise/react-impl/pages.html


# Questions

## Do I need to use a database?

No, data can be stored however you like, so long as it can be re-edited later. This can be in a flat file, the session, or even in-memory in the browser if providing a JS only implementation. We're interested how you go about separating the data store from the UI. 

## Do I need to write a user management system?

No, the 'login' system can be as simple as checking a hardcoded username and password, and setting a session flag that the user is logged in. We're wanting to see that you can handle requests to 'protected' actions

## Can I use a framework?

Absolutely! You may have your own library of code that you use to roll together small applications, or prefer to use a 3rd party framework like Zend, Sapphire, Symfony, Cake etc. Any existing code libraries that do some or all of the above can be used. The one caveat being that it must be able to be distributed (so, open source or home baked) along with your response so that we can evaluate it.

## Do I need to provide documentation?

Only so we can get your code up and running - assume a standard LAMP stack on our end.

## Do I need to provide unit tests?

Not required, but we won't ignore them if they are provided.

## How long should this take?

We don't want you to spend much more than a few hours putting together a response, so feel free to drop out functionality. The key bits are being able to list the pages, display a selected page, and adding a new page to the list of pages. 

Don't hesitate to email jobs@symbiote.com.au with any queries and we'll get back to you asap.



# This repository

This repository contains 2 sample solutions to the 
above exercise that we use as part of our technical
hiring roles. 

If you are interested in submitting a response, please read the overview above,
and send a github link to jobs@symbiote.com.au

The two solutions in this repository are _not_ meant to be an example of the 
best solution to the problem, but to provide a guideline to what the bare minumum
functional solution should provide - think of them as the low bar. 

If you have stumbled across this, and are looking for a job, see the 
'overview' file contained within and have a go, then send an email to 
jobs@symbiote.com.au
